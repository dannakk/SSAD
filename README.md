## Running the source file
1. Once you have opened the project in IntelliJ IDEA, your job is to find the Main.java file located inside the project. 
2. Then, you need to press the run button at the top right panel
3. After some seconds of waiting, you should expect a 'Enter your string' command
4. You should then immediately start entering the string you wish to be inversed. You can use both lowercase and uppercase letters. If you wish to enter several words separated by whitespace, it will still work, and you will be getting Zero position for any whitespace.
5. Once you have entered the input string, you now need to press Enter command and you will get several numbers separated by whitespace. The first number is the position of the last letter in the string and and the last number number is the position
6. If you want to run again, just press the right button at the top
7. Enjoy!

### 🗣 The goal of the program
The idea of the program is that you will enter any string (in lowercase or uppercase or both) and as a result you will get the alphabetical position of its inverted string

### 🧠 What have we learned from developing the program?
This program has allowed us to have an introduction to Java programming language by learning to inverse the string and find its alphabetical position using the array looping.
